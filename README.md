# BaseballLeague

This program lets you emulate an entire baseball league. You can create teams, create players, sign players to a team, release players from a team, trade players, show the entire career of a player, and display all data of the league. I used object oriented programming to create classes for the players and teams. NOTE: I did not make the parser but I did the rest of this project.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./play

    Then choose from the list for what action you want to do
